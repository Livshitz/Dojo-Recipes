# Introduction:
This is the Recipes repo for [Dojo-SDK](https://github.com/Livshitz/Dojo-SDK), please refer to the original repo for more background.  

Here you'll find a collection of Recipes, e.g software-design and architecture challenges to be implemented via dojo-sdk tools.  
Each recipe contains a description of the problem to be solved, context, function and non-functional requirements and validation process.  
Each solution should be **deterministic** and contain tests that can be ran to validate the solution.  
The purpose of those Recipes is educational and for practicing real-world challenges and real-world simulated environment. Which are usually hard to simulate as close to reality as possible with simple whiteboard sketching.
